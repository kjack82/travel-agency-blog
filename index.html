<title> Kate's Travel Stories</title>
<h1>My recent trip to Australia!</h1>
<h3>The highs and the lows!</h3>
<p> After having our initial trip cancelled in 2020 due to the ongoing Covid restrictions,
    we finally got to jet off on the holiday off a lifetime. However just like the saying 
    "never meet your hero", this trip was a little like that!</p>
<p>My top 5 highlights were as follows;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Rottnest Island</li>
    <li>High ropes course in Margaret River</li>
    <li>Dolphin cruise</li>
    <li>The vibes at Mindarie</li>
    <li>The beaches in general, but Hamelin Bay was probably my favourite</li>
    <br>
<p>The 5 things I did not love;</p>
<ol>
<ul>
    <li>Everywhere was quiet. As a result, it lacked that buzz in most places.</li>
    <li>It's not an old country, so it lacks history and culture.</li>
    <li>Food choice was limited. Menus were small, and lacked diversity.</li>
    <li>Everywhere is so far away as every town in built along the coast.</li>
    <li>Every car was huge! Not great for the environment</li>
</ul>
